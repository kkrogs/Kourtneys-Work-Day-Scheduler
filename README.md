# Kourtneys-Work-Day-Scheduler
The title of this project is Kourtneys-Work-Day-Scheduler. The reason why this project is so important is because it will showcase my knowledge of Javascript to prospective employers.

HOW IT WORKS: When the user enters the program, they are presented with a Work Day Scheduler where they can enter in their activities for the day per hour from 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM.

After creating an activity, the user can save the activity by clicking on the red 'save' button next to it.

Once saved, the activity will save over to localStorage on the browser.
